			<p>MyLife gathers personal information through public records and other sources to automatically generate a "MyLife Public Page" for each person, described by MyLife as a "complete Wikipedia-like biography on every American."[1] A MyLife Public Page can list a wide variety of personal information, including an individual's age, past and current home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employers, education, photographs, relatives, political affiliations, a mini biography, and a personal review section which encourages other MyLife members to rate each other.</p>

			 MyLife claims to have over 225 million Public Pages with information about almost everyone in America, 18 years old and over.[2] According to MyLife, a Public Page can only be edited or removed if it is "claimed", a process that involves registering with the website and providing a credit card number or a government-issued photo ID.[3] The site also allows people to search for any person in the United States, read their auto-generated Public Page, and review them.</p>
